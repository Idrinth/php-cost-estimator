# Contributing

Thank f√ºr for considering being a contributor. I'm very happy about any contribution - no matter if big or small.

## Issues

If you have ideas, found a bug or want something clarified, please open an issue of the appropriate type. I will answer as fast as possible.

## Documentation

Right now there is no explicit documentation available. This is mostly due to the age and progress on the project, but feel free to be an early starter and help others by expanding the readme.

## Tests

The more tests the better! Try to find edge cases, missing implementation details or just hunt some mutants generated by infection. The intention is to reach 100% line coverage as well as wipe out all mutants. Make sure to have the CI passing please.

## Implementations

If you find a small bug or feature you want to implement, go right ahead. If possible add unit tests, since there is no way to manually test everything. The CI is configured to help you fit right in, so don't hesitate.

## Personalised Support

If you want or need personalised support that can't be done over issues don't hesitate to write me a mail at self@bjoern-buettner.me - I don't guarantee response times, but will usually answer within 24h. I may charge for this specialised support, since it doesn't benefit the community directly.
